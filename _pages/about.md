Hi, I’m Ryan Convery, a Computer Engineering student at Virginia Tech with a passion for embedded systems, software development, and game design. I enjoy working on projects that bridge hardware and software, from low-level programming in C and MIPS assembly to image processing and game development.

My experience includes developing custom algorithms, optimizing embedded systems, and experimenting with signal processing and circuit design. Whether it’s creating a game engine, designing PCBs, or working with real-time systems, I thrive on solving complex problems and pushing the limits of technology.

Currently, I’m exploring opportunities for internships and co-ops to gain hands-on experience in the industry. If you’re interested in collaborating or learning more about my work, feel free to reach out!
